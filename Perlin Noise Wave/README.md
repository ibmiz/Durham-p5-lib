# Perlin Noise Wave

This is a fork off [Perlin Noise Wave](https://www.openprocessing.org/sketch/576489)

## Wave Class
This class takes in these parameters for its constructor 
- ysliderval and xsliderval: which change the height and width of the wave respectively
- noiseF: is a randomly generated number that effects the noise of the wave. The mouse movement also effects the noise
- ofs: offset the waves to have different heights 
- h: is the density i.e how many waves are produced
- waveH: is defined by the xsliderval
- colour1 and colour2: changes the colour of the waves
